Register for your Free license.

With this license you can use most features of altium within this file, ie, cross probing, viewing etc...

To edit, you will need a licenced version of Altium.

As the FMU is 8 layers, it cannot be made in the free version of Eagle... but I would be happy if someone 
could help with the conversion to any other file formats.

Please contact me by raising an issue here.
